#Shopping List App

Overview
- The Shopping List App is a simple iOS application built with SwiftUI and Core Data, designed to help users manage shopping lists. Users can create categories (e.g., Groceries, Electronics) with custom tax rates, add items to each category,    and generate an invoice (tax receipt) summarizing their purchases with tax calculations. The app features a clean, user-friendly interface with a splash screen, category list, item list, and invoice view.

Key Features
- Category Management: Add, view, and delete categories with user-defined tax rates.
- Item Management: Add, view, and delete items within categories, with name and price details.
- Tax Calculation: Calculate taxes for each category based on user-entered tax rates.
- Invoice Generation: Generate a detailed invoice showing items grouped by category, with subtotals, taxes, and a grand total.
- Local Storage: Persist data using Core Data, ensuring categories and items are saved on the device.
- Improved Design: Includes a splash screen, empty-state messages, icons, and consistent styling with custom colors (olive green and off-white).

- Xcode: Version 15.0 or later
- iOS: Version 16.0 or later
